We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?
Examples (input --> output):

# create function that converts a number to a string
# function takes in a num as an int and must return that same number as a string


def number_to_string(num):

    return str(num)


# Test cases
print(number_to_string(234))
